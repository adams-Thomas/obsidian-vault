## Phase 1 Brief

When a user loads the website they are shown a home page with the specials for that day period. The user does not need to sign in to view the specials and to filter the list of specials they can view.

A user account has to be created to be able to create specials, like specials and report specials. When creating an account the user needs to provide first name, last name, email and password. The user will then receive an email asking them to verify. A user can reset their password via email. A user can request/awarded verification, they have to reach out and provide proof that they are a legitimate organiser or restaurant. Verification can also be removed for numerous reasons.
A user can be reported by another user, a reason needs to be provided. 

A special is created by a user and requires the following information: Title, Description, Time period, custom times (if applicable), Location and tags.
The user will have to search for a location. If the location is found locally then it is assigned to the special, if not Google maps will be utilized for finding and saving the location.
At least one tag is required per special. Example: Mexican or Indian. The user will have to search tags and if it is not found, it will be added locally. A user can archive their own specials. This means it will not be viewable to other visitors to the site. The user then has 30 days before it is automatically deleted.
When creating a special the user has to select a time period. They can select from Breakfast (open - 10am), lunch (10am - 5pm), dinner (5pm - close), all day, custom. 

Users can report other specials. They have to supply a reason as to why they are reporting the specials. If a speical gets enough valid reports, it is then archived and then subject to deletion in 30 days (The user who created can no longer un report it).
