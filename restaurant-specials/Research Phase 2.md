Two questions need to be answered before even proof of concept considered:
1. Can you scrape or access public posts on Social Media via an API.
   - [x] Facebook (Dealbreaker)
   - [x] Instagram (Dealbreaker)
   - [ ] Twitter (NON Dealbreaker)
2. Can you filter said data according to contents, date-time, location?


###### Can you scrape or access public posts on Social Media via API?

**Facebook**
Reading documentation it appears possible to make API calls for pages and posts for those pages.
Just requires app verification and certain features being enabled.

[Search For Page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/searching/)
[GraphQL Endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer?method=GET&path=pages%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DChingadas%26fields%3Did%2Cname%2Clocation%2Clink%26access_token%3D%7Baccess-token%7D&version=v15.0)

**Instagram**
Seems to be possible but a fat mission

## I am going to have to continue with restaurants special and then incorporate Facebook and Instagram usage
